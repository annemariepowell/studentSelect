<p>Scenario
	Our client does not have a good system or secure way of having their students participate using any stable/sure way.
	You can have each student participate with an efficient system such as this one: a student name shuffler that shuffles
	a group of studentsâ€™ names and randomly selects one to do whatever the teacher needs; for example answering a question and otherwise 
	participate.Then you can have it go to the next student and so on.
