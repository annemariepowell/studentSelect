Problem in 250 words
	Our client does not have a good system or secure way of having their students participate using any stable/sure way. You can have each student participate with an efficient system such as this one: a student name shuffler that shuffles a group of students’ names and randomly selects one to do whatever the teacher needs; for example answering a question and otherwise participate.Then you can have it go to the next student and so on.
