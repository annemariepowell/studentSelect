Problem in 250 words
	Our client does not have a good system or secure way of having their students participate using any stable/sure way. You can have each student participate with an efficient system such as this one: a student name shuffler that shuffles a group of studentsâ€™ names and randomly selects one to do whatever the teacher needs; for example answering a question and otherwise participate.Then you can have it go to the next student and so on. 

# IA Interview with Mrs. Murder

Interviewer:  Is it challenging to get kids to participate in class?

Murder:  Yes, it's always the same 4-5 kids in class who are answering questions.

Interviewer:  I have an application to fix that which would randomly pick students depending on the class, what would that app need to do to best assess your needs in solving the stated problem?

Murder:  Well I would need to have the ability to exlude kids from the list as many have 401 IEP plans where I cannot legally call on them during class.

Interviewer: The application doesn't have the feature of excluding students however it won't pick the student if you don't enter in the name so you can just exclude them from the list.

Murder: Right

Interviewer: Would you use this application for classes?

Murder: Probably not for algebra 1-2 due to the fact most of the kids have had really bad math experiences and a lot of anxiety and I don't want them to feel pressured.  But for the IB classes like yours it would be great because a lot of students are scared of getting the wrong answer, but that's what they need to do in order to learn.
