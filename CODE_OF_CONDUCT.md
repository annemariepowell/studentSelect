# Code of Conduct
Let me make this short and sweet.

Here are the rules.  If you don't follow them, we won't accept your pull requests.

# RULES
* **Be kind**.  This is a high school project, the developers are learning and aren't gurus.  If you see a dumb mistake, don't be rude about it, be courteous and explain the issue with the intention of education, not condemnation.
* **Don't remove features**.  Reworking a feature is fine, removing a feature is not.
* **Cite sources**.  Don't use code snippets that aren't yours in your pull request without citing a source or adding one to the acknowledgements.html.  We are for intellectual honesty, not against.
